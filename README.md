# Introduction
In April of 2022, [Zack Freedman](https://www.youtube.com/c/ZackFreedman/about) announced Gridfinity to the world in this video:

[![Gridfinity: Your Ultimate Modular Workshop is FREE!](https://img.youtube.com/vi/ra_9zU-mnl8/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ra_9zU-mnl8)

Using a design based on earlier work by [Alexandre Chappel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe1Aj6VEO299Yq4WkXdoD3Q), Zach designed a modular system that uses a gridded baseplate that accomodates blocks sized to fit into one or more grid cells. After the publication of Zach's video, other designers began to adopt existing designs and to create new ones. This page is an attempt to catalog as many Gridfinity resources as possible.
